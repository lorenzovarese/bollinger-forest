# Bollinger Forest ðŸ“ˆ

### Project Overview

**Bollinger Forest** is a quantitative trading strategy project aimed at implementing the strategy described in the research paper *"Enhanced Bollinger Band Stock Quantitative Trading Strategy Based on Random Forest"* by Keyue Yan, Yimeng Wang, and Ying Li, published in **Artificial Intelligence Evolution**. The project combines **Random Forest** with **Bollinger Bands** to predict stock movements and improve trading performance for financial banking stocks in the Hong Kong stock market. The enhanced strategy seeks to generate higher returns compared to traditional Bollinger Band strategies by accurately predicting the next dayâ€™s Weighted Moving Average (WMA).

3. **Data Preparation**:
   Place the raw stock data in the `data/raw` folder. You can also download stock data using the `src/data_preprocessing/download_data.py` script.

### Usage

1. **Preprocess stock data**:
   ```bash
